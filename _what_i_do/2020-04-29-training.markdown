description: This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Now then, let's play. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Just make little strokes like that. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here.
