description: This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. We'll put a happy little sky in here.
