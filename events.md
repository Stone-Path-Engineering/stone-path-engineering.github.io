## Hardware Happy Hour

October 26th, 2023 – 4:30-6:30 PM
Maple Studios, 1207 Maple Street, West Des Moines

Hardware Happy Hour is an informal way to socialize, share projects and ideas, and talk about the world of electronics. Whether your company is building a new thing to go on the internet, you work as a firmware developer or electrical engineer, you’re an enthusiastic hobbyist, or are merely curious about those things and the people doing them, we’d like to meet you!

  – If you’d like, bring a project to share with others. Not in a show-and-tell sort of way, just to spark conversations with those around you.
